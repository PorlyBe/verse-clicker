# Verse Clicker

A simple addictive game that engages users to ‘click for verse’. Concept is based off [cookie clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) and other similar ‘incremental’ and ‘idle’ style games such as [adventure capitalist](https://kbhgames.com/game/adventure-capitalist).

Users will be able to make in-game purchases to improve their click-rate and additional bonuses. A global leaderboard will show users who have achieved the highest levels.
